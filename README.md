# üîí P2P Secure Chat Application

A peer-to-peer encrypted chat application with text messaging, file transfer, and video call capabilities, designed for secure local network communication.

## ‚ú® Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**
  - RSA-2048 with OAEP padding for all communications
  - Automatic key exchange and verification
  - SHA-256 file integrity checking

- **Automatic Network Discovery**
  - UDP broadcast for peer discovery on local network
  - Public key exchange during discovery

- **Multi-mode Communication**
  - üí¨ Encrypted text chat with timestamps
  - üìÅ Secure file transfers with hash verification
  - üìπ Video calls with audio (WebRTC-like functionality)
  - üîä Low-latency voice communication

- **Security Features**
  - Public key verification before connection
  - Encrypted metadata for file transfers
  - Connection timeout handling

## üõ† System Requirements

### Software
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required packages:

pip install cryptography opencv-python numpy sounddevice pyaudio



Hardware:
Webcam (for video calls)
Microphone (for voice calls)
Speakers/headphones


>>Getting Started

Installation:
git clone https://github.com/kailas-santhosh/CN_Project.git
cd CN_Project
pip install -r requirements.txt



Running the Application:

python p2p_chat.py <your_username> OR python3 p2p_chat.py <your_username>


Basic Commands:
/help               - Show all commands
/list               - List available peers
/connect <username> - Connect to a peer
/msg <message>      - Send a text message
/sendfile <path>    - Send a file
/videocall          - Start video/voice call
/disconnect         - End current connection
/exit               - Quit the application



Technical Details

Network Architecture:

Uses both TCP (reliable) and UDP (real-time) protocols
TCP for text messages and file transfers
UDP for video/audio streaming
Encryption Scheme

RSA-2048 for key exchange
OAEP padding with SHA-256 hashing
Each message encrypted individually
Port Usage

Main chat port: Auto-selected (5000-6000)
Discovery port: 37020 (UDP)
Video port: Main port + 100 (UDP)
Audio port: Main port + 101 (UDP)
üìù Notes

The application works best on local networks (LAN)
Firewalls may need adjustment to allow UDP traffic
First run may be slow due to RSA key generation
